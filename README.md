# intro2D3_examples

Some html/js/flask-python files created for a basic demo of D3 using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for one of the investigations I did.
In the Docs folder, you will find the relevant files.  

To view these files you need to activate a simple server.   
You can fork/download the folder/files locally and then open a terminal pointing to the directory and use a simple server to run these files. 
```
 # >> intro2D3_examples/tree/master/docs/
 >> python3 -m http.server --bind 0.0.0.0 8000
```

and you can point your browser to the local host http://localhost:8000/  
and there will be a directory listing where you can click to display e.g.

```
- http://localhost:8000/h-rmtan_D3_Example_iris.html
- http://localhost:8000/h-rmtan_D3_Examples_svg.html
```

Alternatively, you could open your terminal in the app folder and run the app with python
```
# >> intro2D3_examples/tree/master/docs/d3_example_web_app/
>> python d3_example_app.py 
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger pin code: 165-194-229
```
And you can point your browser to http://localhost:8080/ 
and you should see the page looking like this:
